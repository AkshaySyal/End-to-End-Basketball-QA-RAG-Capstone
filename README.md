# End-to-End-Basketball-QA-RAG-Capstone

## Purpose
This project aims to democratize basketball analytics by addressing the challenges non-technical users face when working with complex datasets due to limited SQL expertise. By developing a fine-tuned LLM-powered system, the project simplifies SQL query generation, ensuring accurate and consistent data-driven insights. The ultimate goal is to make analytics accessible, enabling better coaching strategies, player evaluations, and fan engagement while tackling key issues like LLM hallucinations and inconsistencies.
## Goal 
These are our technical goals for this project:
- Fine-tune an open source LLM for generating semantically correct SQL queries to answer Analytics Queries
- Deploy the LLM on cloud
- Deploy Chatbot application created using LangChain
- Apply Object-Oriented Design Principles to enhance code quality and maintainability for critical scripts (eg: Benchmarking Script)
- Create workflow for data augmentation to make our own dataset for fine-tuning
